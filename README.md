# Unsupervise-Machine-Learning-applied-to-Magnetic-Systems

On this repository you will find the implementation of some algorithms for the simulation of crystaline magnetic systems with the Montecarlo method, under the Ising and Heisemberg models. Once the data is ready there are some graphics codes and  the implementation of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) as an unsupervised Machine Learning method for the analysis of the data.
Also you will find some documentationa bout this process and its implications.
